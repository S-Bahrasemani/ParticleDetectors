\section{Neutrino}
%%%%%%% SLIDE
\begin{frame}{\textcolor{Goldenrod}{Neutrino}}
  \note{The history of the neutrino goes back to 1914, when J. Chadwick
    first demonstrated that the beta−spectrum from the decay of a
    radioactive element was continuous, as opposed to the alpha- or
    gamma-spectrum. This seemed to imply a missing particle – or even
    possibly, as it was thought at the time, a breakdown of energy
    conservation.}
  
  \hlt{RoyalBlue}{Neutrino is so named because it is electrically neutral and
    because its rest mass is so small (-ino) that it was originally
    thought to be zero.}
  \itt
\item<2-> neutrino was postulated first by Wolfgang Pauli in
  1930 to explain how beta decay could conserve energy, momentum,
  and angular momentum (spin).
  \note{The weak force has a very short range, gravity
    is extremely weak on the subatomic scale, and neutrinos, as leptons,
    do not participate in the strong interaction}
\note{Pauli did not expect that his hypothetical new particle would ever be
  observed. However, in the early 1950s, F. Reines and C.L. Cowan Jr.,
  encouraged by B. Pontecorvo, set up a decisive experiment at the
  Savannah River nuclear reactor in South Carolina, demonstrating that
  (anti)neutrinos produced in the reactor processes sometimes interacted
  with protons in the detector medium, each reaction resulting in a
  neutron and a positron which could be registered (so-called inverse
  $\beta$-decay). This was the long awaited unambiguous proof of the existence
  of the neutrino, and in June 1956, just two years before Pauli’s
  death, Reines and Cowan could send a telegram informing Pauli of their
  discovery.}

\item<3-> neutrinos typically pass through normal matter unimpeded and
  undetected.
\item<4-> \color{red}{The assumption that neutrinos are massless and characterised by
    distinct, individual lepton numbers was incorporated into the theory
    of electro-weak interactions. }

  Tesla dipole magnetic field. The total volume of the drift chambers is
  about $ 3 \times 3\times 4 m^3$)

    role of a nearly isoscalar target1 for neutrino interac- tions and of
    tracking medium.

  \note{The average density of the drift chamber volume was 0.1 g/cm3.

    reconstruction of better than 95\% and a momentum resolution which can
    be approximated by the following formula $\frac{\sigma_p}{p} \approx
    \frac{0.05}{\sqrt{L}}$}

  (the assignment of tracks to vertices), to reconstruct the vertex
  position and the track parameters at each vertex and, finally, to
  identify the vertex type (primary, secondary, etc.).
  
\item A transition radiation detector (TRD) placed at the end of the
  active target was used for particle identification. Two scintillation
  counter trigger planes were used to trigger on neutrino interactions
  in the NOMAD active target.
\item A lead-glass electromagnetic calorimeter located downstream of
  the tracking region provided an energy resolution of $3.2/\sqrt{E}
  \oplus 1$\% for electromagnetic showers and was crucial to measure the
  total energy flow in neutrino interactions.

\item In addition, an iron absorber and a set of muon chambers located
