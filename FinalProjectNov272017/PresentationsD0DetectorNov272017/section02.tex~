  \item
    eight concentric cylinders that enclose the SMT\\
    the cylinder walls are made of two layers of closely
    spaced scintillating fibres.\\
    The fibres in one of the two layers
    are aligned with the beam axis, while the fibres in the other
    layer are arranged at a three degree relative angle allowing for
    stereo measurements to be made

 \item The SMT provides both tracking and vertexing over nearly the
   full $\eta$ coverage of the calorimeter and muon systems.
   
 \item The barrel detectors primarily measure the r − φ coordinate and
   the disk detectors measure r − z as well as r − φ.

 \item The detector has six barrels in the central region. Each barrel
   has four silicon readout layers. The silicon modules installed in
   the barrels are called “ladders.” Layers 1 and 2 have twelve
   ladders each; layers 3 and 4 have twenty-four ladders each, for a
   total of 432 ladders.
   
 \item There are 144 F-wedges and 96 full H-wedges in the tracker;
   each side of a wedge (upstream and downstream) is read out
   independently. There is a grand total of 912 readout modules, with
   792,576 channels.
 \item The SMT is read out by custom-made 128-channel SVXIIe readout
   chips.
